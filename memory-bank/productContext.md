# Product Context: RosterFlow

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
The hospitality industry struggles with outdated, clunky rostering systems that are either:
- **Too Complex**: Enterprise solutions with unnecessary features and steep learning curves
- **Too Simple**: Basic spreadsheets or calendar apps that lack industry-specific functionality
- **Poor UX**: Interfaces that staff actively avoid using, leading to communication breakdowns

### Market Gap
Existing solutions fail to provide:
1. **Visual Clarity**: Most systems use text-heavy interfaces instead of intuitive visual representations
2. **Hospitality-Specific Structure**: Generic scheduling tools don't understand venue areas, sections, and roles
3. **Real-Time Cost Awareness**: Managers need immediate visibility into labor costs while building rosters
4. **Modern User Experience**: Clean, responsive interfaces that work across devices

## How It Should Work

### Core User Experience
**"The modern roster for hospitality that teams will actually enjoy using"**

### Primary Workflows

#### 1. Initial Setup (Onboarding)
- **Goal**: Get venues operational quickly
- **Experience**: Guided setup wizard that captures location structure
- **Outcome**: Ready-to-use system with areas and sections configured

#### 2. Staff Management
- **Goal**: Maintain accurate employee database
- **Experience**: Simple forms with hospitality-relevant fields (availability, pay rates, locations)
- **Outcome**: Staff can be efficiently assigned to appropriate shifts

#### 3. Roster Planning
- **Goal**: Create comprehensive daily rosters
- **Experience**: 
  - Start with calendar month view to see big picture
  - Click days to create/edit rosters
  - Visual timeline shows shift coverage and gaps
  - Real-time cost feedback guides decisions
- **Outcome**: Complete rosters with optimal staff coverage and cost control

#### 4. Shift Assignment
- **Goal**: Assign right person to right place at right time
- **Experience**:
  - Drag-and-drop or form-based shift creation
  - Smart filtering (only show eligible staff for location/role)
  - Visual feedback for conflicts or gaps
- **Outcome**: Precise shift assignments with clear accountability

### Key User Experience Principles

#### Visual First
- **Calendar Grid**: Month view shows roster density and patterns
- **Timeline Blocks**: Shifts appear as positioned blocks on hourly grid
- **Color Coding**: Consistent visual language for areas, roles, status
- **Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly on desktop and tablet

#### Hospitality-Aware
- **Location Hierarchy**: Venues → Areas → sections matches real-world structure
- **Role-Based Logic**: Different roles have different requirements and permissions
- **Availability Tracking**: Respects staff availability and location assignments
- **Cost Consciousness**: Always-visible labor cost calculations

#### Efficiency Focused
- **Minimal Clicks**: Common actions require fewest possible interactions
- **Smart Defaults**: System learns and suggests based on patterns
- **Bulk Operations**: Handle multiple shifts/staff efficiently
- **Quick Navigation**: Easy switching between locations, dates, views

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **Adoption Rate**: Staff actively choose to use the system over alternatives
2. **Task Completion Speed**: Roster creation becomes faster than current methods
3. **Error Reduction**: Fewer scheduling conflicts and coverage gaps
4. **Cost Awareness**: Managers make more informed labor cost decisions

### User Satisfaction Drivers
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Users can accomplish tasks without training
- **Visual Clarity**: Information is immediately understandable
- **Responsive Feedback**: System provides immediate confirmation of actions
- **Error Prevention**: Validation prevents common mistakes before they occur

### Emotional Experience
- **Confidence**: Users feel certain their rosters are complete and accurate
- **Control**: Managers have clear visibility and control over labor costs
- **Efficiency**: Staff feel productive rather than frustrated with the tool
- **Professional**: System reflects well on the venue's operational sophistication
