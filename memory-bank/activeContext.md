# Active Context: RosterFlow Current State

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: **Complete Demo Application**
The RosterFlow application is currently a fully functional demo with all core features implemented. This represents a complete frontend application ready for demonstration and further development.

### Recent Analysis (January 2025)
- **Comprehensive Code Review**: Analyzed entire codebase structure and implementation
- **Architecture Documentation**: Documented all key patterns and technical decisions
- **Feature Assessment**: Confirmed all planned features are implemented and working
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Created complete documentation system for future development

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Architecture Decisions
1. **State Management**: Using React Context + useReducer pattern
   - **Rationale**: Sufficient for current complexity, no external dependencies
   - **Trade-off**: May need Redux for future backend integration
   - **Status**: Working well for demo phase

2. **Component Strategy**: shadcn/ui + custom components
   - **Rationale**: Modern, accessible, customizable components
   - **Trade-off**: Copy-paste approach vs. package dependency
   - **Status**: Excellent developer experience and consistency

3. **Form Management**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
   - **Rationale**: Performance and TypeScript integration
   - **Trade-off**: Learning curve vs. simpler form libraries
   - **Status**: Handling complex nested forms effectively

### Key Implementation Patterns

#### Data Flow Pattern
- **Centralized Store**: All state in single context
- **Action-Based Updates**: Predictable state mutations
- **Derived State**: Computed values with useMemo
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage

#### UI Patterns
- **Visual Timeline**: 8am-11pm grid with positioned shift blocks
- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Location → Area → Section structure
- **Modal Workflows**: Complex forms in dialog overlays
- **Responsive Design**: Desktop and tablet optimized

## Next Steps and Priorities

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Backend Integration Planning**
   - Design API structure for data persistence
   - Plan authentication and authorization system
   - Consider real-time updates for collaborative editing

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Shift conflict detection and warnings
   - Recurring roster templates
   - Staff availability conflict checking
   - Export functionality (PDF, CSV)

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
   - Add service worker for offline capability
   - Optimize bundle size and loading performance

### Technical Debt Considerations
- **Testing**: No test suite currently implemented
- **Error Boundaries**: Limited error handling for production
- **Accessibility**: Could benefit from comprehensive a11y audit
- **Documentation**: API documentation for future backend integration

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Preferences
- **Component Co-location**: Related components grouped by feature
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract complex logic from components
- **Type-First Development**: Define types before implementation
- **Functional Patterns**: Prefer functional components and hooks

### UI/UX Patterns
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features revealed as needed
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time validation and cost calculations
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture
- **Consistent Interactions**: Standardized patterns across features

### Data Management Patterns
- **Immutable Updates**: All state changes through reducers
- **Referential Integrity**: ID-based relationships with usage tracking
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with validation
- **Normalized State**: Flat structures with computed relationships

## Learnings and Project Insights

### What Works Well
1. **Visual Timeline Approach**: Users can immediately understand shift coverage
2. **Hierarchical Location Structure**: Matches real-world venue organization
3. **Real-time Cost Calculation**: Provides immediate budget feedback
4. **Form Validation**: Prevents common scheduling errors
5. **Responsive Design**: Works effectively across device sizes

### Key Technical Insights
1. **Context + useReducer**: Scales well for medium complexity applications
2. **shadcn/ui**: Excellent balance of customization and consistency
3. **React Hook Form**: Handles complex nested forms with good performance
4. **TypeScript**: Essential for maintaining code quality at this scale
5. **Vite**: Significantly better development experience than webpack

### User Experience Insights
1. **Onboarding is Critical**: Empty state needs guided setup
2. **Visual Feedback**: Users need immediate confirmation of actions
3. **Error Prevention**: Better than error correction for scheduling
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, reveal advanced features gradually
5. **Mobile Considerations**: Timeline view needs tablet-optimized layout

## Current Limitations and Known Issues

### Technical Limitations
- **No Data Persistence**: All data lost on page refresh
- **No Conflict Detection**: Can create overlapping shifts for same staff
- **Limited Error Handling**: Basic error boundaries needed
- **No Offline Support**: Requires internet connection

### UX Limitations
- **No Undo/Redo**: Complex operations can't be easily reversed
- **Limited Bulk Operations**: No multi-select for shifts or staff
- **No Templates**: Each roster must be created from scratch
- **No Notifications**: No system for alerting about changes

### Scalability Considerations
- **Memory Usage**: Large datasets may impact performance
- **Rendering Performance**: Timeline with many shifts could be slow
- **State Complexity**: May need more sophisticated state management
- **Bundle Size**: Could benefit from code splitting optimization

## Development Environment Notes

### Current Setup
- **Node.js**: Version 18+ required
- **Package Manager**: npm (package-lock.json present)
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server on port 5173
- **Build Tool**: Vite with SWC for fast compilation

### Development Workflow
1. **Start Development**: `npm run dev`
2. **Type Checking**: Automatic in development
3. **Linting**: `npm run lint`
4. **Building**: `npm run build`
5. **Preview**: `npm run preview`

### Code Quality Tools
- **ESLint**: Configured with TypeScript rules
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **Prettier**: Not configured (could be added)
- **Husky**: Not configured (could add pre-commit hooks)
