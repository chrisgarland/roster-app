### Primary Goals
1. **Multi-Location Support**: Manage rosters across multiple venues/locations
2. **Visual Shift Planning**: Calendar month view and detailed day timeline view
3. **Staff Management**: Complete employee database with availability tracking
4. **Cost Tracking**: Real-time labor cost calculations based on staff pay rates
5. **Hierarchical Organization**: Locations → Areas → Sections structure for precise shift assignment

### Key Features Required
- **Location Management**: Add/edit venues with customizable areas and sections
- **Staff Database**: Employee profiles with roles, contact info, pay rates, availability
- **Roster Creation**: Daily rosters with multiple shifts per day
- **Shift Assignment**: Assign staff to specific roles, areas, sections, and time slots
- **Visual Timeline**: 8am-11pm timeline view showing shifts as positioned blocks
